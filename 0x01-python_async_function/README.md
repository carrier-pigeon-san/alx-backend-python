# Python Async Function

This repository contains projects and exercises related to asynchronous programming in Python. The goal is to understand and implement asynchronous functions using `asyncio` and other related libraries.

## Introduction

Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows for the execution of tasks without blocking the main program flow. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound and high-level structured network code.

## Learning Objectives

- async and await syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `asyncio` library
